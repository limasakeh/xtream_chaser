            <p>There are in fact two incarnations of Sub-Zero, and they are siblings;
                older brother Bi-Han and younger brother Kuai Liang.
                Both are blue garbed warriors who at different times have used the codename "Sub-Zero",
                and both have served the Lin Kuei.
                Both are descended from Cryomancers, an Outworld race possessing the ability
                to generate and control the powers of ice.
                However, they were born in Earthrealm and only the younger Sub-Zero would discover his heritage.
                Kuai iang bears a scar on his right eye However, as seen in Deception, the scar has faded away.
                This may have been caused by the Dragon Medallion's power.</p>

            <p>It is known that his father, a former member of the Shirai Ryu, forbade his son from joining the clan,
                as he did not wish for his son to live the life of an assassin.
                However, he joined in spite of his father's wishes in 
                order to provide his wife and son with a comfortable life
                Now Scorpion is a hell-spawned spectre, inexorably seeking vengeance
                against those responsible for the destruction of his clan
                and the death of his own family.
                Despite his malevolent appearance, he is not inherently evil.
                He joins the forces of evil when promised a means of resurrecting his clan on Earth,
                or the chance to inflict his wrath against those who butchered them.
                Scorpion has also (indirectly) assisted the game's protagonists to fulfill these motives.</p>

            <p>Raiden is the eternal God of Thunder, protector of Earthrealm.
                After the second defeat of Shinnok, he ascended to the status of Elder God. Being a God,
                he possesses many supernatural abilities,
                such as the ability to teleport, control lightning and fly. As a God,
                he is used to thinking in terms of eternity rather than normal human lifespans,
                and so he has a radically different outlook on life. This is not to say he is incapable of
                understanding human values and psyches.</p>

            <p>He is portrayed as an archetypal African American hero.
                In the Special Forces' chain of command,
                he is Sonya Blade's direct superior and the catalyzing force of Sonya's impulsiveness.
                Jax is clear-headed, careful and always keeping a watch on what his men are doing.
                When the need arises, he is a beast on the
                battlefield with the attitude and ferocity of a lion.
                He unscrupulously makes use of the most advanced
                technology to improve both himself and his unit.
                He is responsible for the crime lord Kano's disfigurement,
                forcing him to wear a metal plate over a portion of his face.</p>

                who relied too much on stunts and camera work and was not really a proficient fighter.
                Eventually, he became one of the most important defenders of Earth.
                Despite his materialism, airheadedness,
                and occasional immaturity, Cage has always been a brave and loyal warrior for Earthrealm,

                He is an opportunist and will ally himself with anyone

                He is notable in particular for his ruthlessness and pragmatism.
                His manipulative and deceptive nature has earned him many enemies,

                Said to be physically hideous and repulsive,
                he is renowned for his great stealth and unquestioning loyalty.
                Unlike many other henchmen,
                Reptile does not strive for power. He is caught in a delusional state of mind,
                obsessed with finding the last remaining member of his race,
                or freeing his homeworld of Zaterra from Outworld's grasp.
                Thus, he always remains loyal to Shao Kahn, only obeying other masters
                to survive and reach his goal of returning Zaterra to its former glory.
                While well-meaning and sincere,
                his obsession is so important to him that it causes him temporary fits of insanity.</p>

            <p>Ermac has been a controversial and mysterious character

                Ermac is a fusion of the many souls destroyed in Outworld's wars, only to be controlled by
                Emperor Shao Kahn and his Shadow Priests.
                Because of this,
                he refers to himself as "we", "our", "us", and "ours'", instead of "I", "my" "me", and mine"
                Because of the sheer concentration of souls within Ermac,
                he possesses the gifts of telekinesis, teleportation, and the ability to travel between realms.</p>

            <p>Shinnok relies less on brute strength and fear-mongering,
                but more on magical powers, ancient artifacts and manipulation.
                He is the ruler of the Netherrealm,
                possessing millions of years' worth of knowledge and power.
                He can impersonate any other beings of his choosing,
                as well as to transform into an immense demon.
                He also possesses extreme cunning,
                as well as the ability to manipulate events through others.
                he had Quan Chi convince Shao Kahn to merge Earthrealm with Outworld
                against the Elder Gods' will.
                As a result, both realms were severely weakened
                and left ขulnerable to invasion by the Netherrealm.</p>
